# ProtoMapping

This site contains supplementary material for the article:

Arndt Hansen, C., & Ozkil, A. G. (2019), From Idea to Production: A Retrospective and Longitudinal Case Study of Prototypes and Prototyping Strategies, Journal of Mechanical Design, 1-47.

The ProtoMap visualizes six years of prototyping carried out by the hardware startup PeeFence. They built their first prototype in 2013 to prove that their idea for a fence-based urinal could improve the sanitary conditions at festivals.
