The ProtoMap visualizes six years of prototyping carried out by the hardware startup PeeFence. They built their first prototype in 2013 to prove that their idea for a fence-based urinal could improve the sanitary conditions at festivals.

## Reading the ProtoMap

The ProtoMap structures all prototyping activities in a development process on two axes. The vertical axis presents the alternative concepts that have been prototyped, while the horizontal axis presents the iterations made for each concept. Above the horizontal axis, we find prototypes for the full product, while the prototypes below the horizontal axis focus on a specific sub-part or sub-function of the product. The sub-functional prototypes are separated in individual swimming-lanes.

The ProtoMap emerges through three layers of information:

1)    The prototypes

2)    The prototype attributes

3)    The information flows

### The prototypes

The green boxes represent each new prototype that was made and red boxes show how a prototype was tested. The boxes are placed on the map expanding in the horizontal direction for new iterations and vertical direction for new concepts.

The prototyping activities are connected horizontally and vertically. This symbol is used, when a number of concepts are synthesised in an integrated prototype.

A red X marks every time a concept is eliminated and will not be prototyped any further.

### The prototype attributes

Each box contains a number of symbols, which indicate the attributes or characteristics for that prototype or prototype test, such as the type of prototype that was made or the manufacturing process that was used.

The prototype media is identified for each prototype. Is the prototype as physical model, a virtual model or a sketch?

The manufacturing processes are indicated using this symbol, with the process name written in its centre. Several manufacturing techniques may have been used to fabricate a single prototype.

These symbols provide further detail on how the prototypes were fabricated, but are not commented on in the article. It is indicated whether standard components were used, whether elements were produced by external manufacturers and whether technical drawings were produced as part of the prototyping.

For each prototype test, it is indicated whether the prototype tested the functionality and technical elements of the prototype, tested the user interaction and desirability with real users, or whether it tested a manufacturing process for future production.

Other symbols can be added in the future, e.g. indicating fidelity, cost or time spend on each prototype.

### The information flows

The individual prototyping activities affect each other. Yellow arrows indicate these interactions.

A downwards pointing arrow shows when new isolated prototypes were initiated based on feedback from a previous integrated test.

![structure](prototypingplanner.github.io/icons-15.png)

A backwards pointing arrow shows significant points of iterations where several prototypes were made to improve a design using the same methods.

This arrow shows other relationships between prototypes.
