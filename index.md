Here you can find supporting material for our research publications about the use of prototyping in product development.
Take a look around.

## The Prototyping Planner

The Prototyping Planner is a 1-page template that aims to teach students how to create purposeful prototypes.

## ProtoMapping

*ProtoMapping* is a visualization struture that allows us to document the product development process and observe the use of prototyping strategies over time.

In our paper: [From Idea to Production: A Retrospective and Longitudinal Case Study of Prototypes and Prototyping Strategies](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article/142/3/031115/1066327/From-Idea-to-Production-A-Retrospective-and) we created a ProtoMap for the startup company PeeFence.
